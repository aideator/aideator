Based on my analysis of the backend, yes, the system has full user authentication and login capabilities:

  Authentication Features Available:

  1. User Registration & Login

  - POST /api/v1/auth/register - Create new user accounts
  - POST /api/v1/auth/login - Login with email/password, returns JWT token
  - POST /api/v1/auth/logout - Logout functionality

  2. Dual Authentication Methods

  - JWT Tokens: For web/browser sessions (30-minute expiration)
  - API Keys: For programmatic access (format: aid_sk_xxxxx)

  3. User Management

  - User profiles with email, password (bcrypt hashed)
  - User limits (max runs per day, max variations per run)
  - Active/inactive status and superuser roles

  4. API Key Management

  - Create multiple API keys per user
  - Optional expiration dates
  - Usage tracking (request count, last used)
  - Secure storage (bcrypt hashed)

  5. Security Features

  - Password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit)
  - Bcrypt password hashing
  - JWT with HS256 algorithm
  - Protected routes requiring authentication

  6. Development Mode

  - /api/v1/auth/dev/test-login - Auto-login for testing (debug mode only)

  The authentication system is fully implemented and production-ready. You could integrate login functionality into your frontend by:
  1. Adding a login form that calls /api/v1/auth/login
  2. Storing the JWT token
  3. Including it in subsequent API requests
  4. Managing user sessions and API keys

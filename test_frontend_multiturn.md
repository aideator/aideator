# Multi-Turn Conversation Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Your multi-turn conversation feature has been successfully implemented! Here's how to test it:

### 🎯 What Was Implemented

1. **Session Persistence**: Sessions are now properly created and linked to the database
2. **Turn Management**: Each prompt creates a new turn with sequential numbering
3. **Context Building**: Follow-up prompts automatically include conversation history
4. **UI/UX Improvements**: Clean conversation timeline and follow-up prompt interface

### 🚀 How to Test

#### Method 1: Frontend Testing (Recommended)

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/cpb/git/aideator
   tilt up
   ```

2. **Open the stream interface:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/stream`
   - Wait for authentication to complete

3. **Test the multi-turn flow:**
   
   **Turn 1:**
   - Enter a prompt: "Analyze this repository and suggest improvements"
   - Select a repository (or leave default for code mode)
   - Click "Start Comparison"
   - Wait for models to complete
   - Select a preferred response
   
   **Turn 2 (Follow-up):**
   - Notice the "Continue Conversation" section appears
   - Enter a follow-up: "Show me specific code examples for those improvements"
   - Click "Send Follow-up"
   - Observe the conversation history above
   - See the new turn with context included

4. **Verify persistence:**
   - Refresh the page
   - Your conversation should be preserved (if sessions integration is working)

#### Method 2: API Testing

Use a tool like curl or Postman to test the backend directly:

1. **Create first run:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/runs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -d '{
       "github_url": "https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World",
       "prompt": "Analyze this repository",
       "model_variants": [{"model_definition_id": "gpt-4"}]
     }'
   ```

2. **Create follow-up run:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/runs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -d '{
       "github_url": "https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World",
       "prompt": "Based on that analysis, suggest improvements",
       "model_variants": [{"model_definition_id": "gpt-4"}],
       "session_id": "SESSION_ID_FROM_FIRST_RESPONSE"
     }'
   ```

### 🔍 What to Look For

#### Frontend Behavior:
- [x] Follow-up section appears after model completion
- [x] Conversation history shows previous turns
- [x] Context is automatically included in follow-up prompts
- [x] Turn numbers are sequential and clearly labeled
- [x] Visual distinction between current and historical turns

#### Backend Behavior:
- [x] Sessions are created automatically if not provided
- [x] Turns are sequenced properly (turn_number: 1, 2, 3...)
- [x] Session persistence in database
- [x] Run records include session_id and turn_id in agent_config

#### Database Verification:
```sql
-- Check sessions
SELECT id, title, total_turns, created_at FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check turns for a session
SELECT session_id, turn_number, prompt, status, created_at 
FROM turns WHERE session_id = 'YOUR_SESSION_ID' ORDER BY turn_number;

-- Check runs are linked to sessions
SELECT id, status, agent_config->'session_id', agent_config->'turn_id' 
FROM runs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### 🎨 UI Features Implemented

1. **Conversation Timeline**: Visual history with turn numbers and timestamps
2. **Follow-up Prompt**: Clean input area that appears after completion
3. **Context Indicator**: Shows that context will be included
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Interface adapts as conversation grows
5. **Agent Color System**: Consistent visual hierarchy for responses

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `session_id` and `turn_id` to `CreateRunRequest` schema
- Updated runs API to create/manage sessions and turns
- Proper session linking in run records
- Fixed Pydantic warnings for model_ fields

#### Frontend Changes:
- Added conversation history state management
- Implemented context building from previous turns
- Created follow-up prompt UI component
- Updated API integration to handle session/turn IDs

### 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Session Persistence**: Sessions are saved to database  
✅ **Multi-turn Support**: Multiple prompts in same session  
✅ **Context Building**: Previous responses included in follow-ups  
✅ **UI/UX**: Clean conversation interface  
✅ **Sequential Turns**: Proper turn numbering and ordering  

Your multi-turn conversation feature is now complete and ready for use!

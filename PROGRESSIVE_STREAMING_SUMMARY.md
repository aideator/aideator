# Progressive Streaming Implementation Summary

## Overview

We successfully implemented true progressive streaming for the AIdeator platform by replacing Dagger with Docker. This change was necessary because Dagger fundamentally buffers output and doesn't support real-time streaming.

## Key Changes

### 1. Docker Service Implementation
- Created `DockerService` class to replace `DaggerModuleService`
- Uses Docker's native container logs API for real-time streaming
- Runs agent scripts as the main container process (not exec)
- Streams logs with `follow=True` for progressive output

### 2. Container Architecture
- Build custom Docker image with all agent scripts
- Execute entire pipeline (clone, setup, run) as container's main command
- Use `container.logs()` instead of `exec_run()` for true streaming

### 3. Agent Orchestrator Updates
- Created `AgentOrchestratorDocker` to manage Docker containers
- Parallel execution of multiple agent variations
- Real-time SSE event streaming as output arrives

## Technical Implementation

### Key Code Pattern
```python
# Run container with script as main process
container = self.client.containers.run(
    image_tag,
    command=["sh", "-c", script_content],
    environment=environment,
    detach=True,
    auto_remove=False,  # Keep container for logs
)

# Stream logs in real-time
log_stream = container.logs(stream=True, follow=True)
for log_line in log_stream:
    yield log_line.decode('utf-8').strip()
    await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield control
```

### Results

The slow agent test demonstrates perfect progressive streaming:
- Events arrive as they're generated (not buffered)
- Exact 1-second delays between count outputs
- Total time matches expected duration (5-6 seconds for 5 counts)

[20:56:39.752] [ 1.70s] Count: 2 (timestamp: 1751939799.751)  # +1.00s
[20:56:40.753] [ 2.70s] Count: 3 (timestamp: 1751939800.753)  # +1.00s
[20:56:41.753] [ 3.70s] Count: 4 (timestamp: 1751939801.753)  # +1.00s
[20:56:42.758] [ 4.70s] Count: 5 (timestamp: 1751939802.758)  # +1.01s
```

## Testing

Three test files demonstrate progressive streaming:
1. `test_progressive_streaming.py` - General streaming validation
2. `test_slow_streaming.py` - Comprehensive test suite
3. `test_direct_slow_streaming.py` - Direct Docker service test

All tests confirm that progressive streaming is working as required for the user experience.

## Next Steps

The progressive streaming implementation is complete and ready for production use. The system now:
- Streams agent output in real-time as it's generated
- Supports multiple concurrent agents with isolated containers
- Provides immediate feedback to users through SSE
- Handles errors gracefully with proper cleanup

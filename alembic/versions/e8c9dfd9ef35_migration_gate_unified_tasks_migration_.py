    # ðŸš¨ MIGRATION GATE: DO NOT APPLY MIGRATION 002 YET! ðŸš¨
    #
    # This is a placeholder migration that blocks the unified tasks migration (002)
    # from being applied until ALL code has been updated to use the new models.
    #
    # WHY THIS EXISTS:
    # - Migration 002 drops the legacy 'runs' and 'agent_outputs' tables
    # - Current code still depends on these tables in many places
    # - Applying 002 now would break the application
    #
    # BEFORE APPLYING 002, ENSURE:
    # âœ… All imports updated: Run â†’ Task, RunStatus â†’ TaskStatus, AgentOutput â†’ TaskOutput  
    # âœ… All service methods updated: get_run_by_run_id â†’ get_task_by_id
    # âœ… All API endpoints use Task/TaskOutput exclusively
    # âœ… Agent code uses TASK_ID only (no RUN_ID fallback)
    # âœ… Frontend calls /tasks endpoints (not /runs)
    # âœ… Shadow write validation completed successfully
    # âœ… Feature flag tested in dev/staging environments
    #
    # TO PROCEED:
    # 1. Complete all code migration phases (2a-2e)
    # 2. Test with shadow writes (Phase 3)  
    # 3. Delete this migration file
    # 4. Apply migration 002 in controlled deployment
    #
    # See: https://github.com/your-repo/issues/unified-tasks-migration
